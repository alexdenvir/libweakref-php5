# [Debian](http://www.debian.org) PHP package for [Weakref](http://pecl.php.net/package/Weakref)
This extension allows to interact with processes through PTY, using expect library.

## Usage
You probably shouldn't be building from these sources. Instead, you should be installing the package via apt-get:
> When the package is accepted!
~~~ sh
sudo apt-get install libweakref-php5
~~~

> If you were looking to build from sources (for some god awful reason, who wants to be a Debian package maintainer anyway?), you should probably be using the tools in devscripts. Read up on the [Debian New Maintainers' Guide](http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/) for details on package maintenance.
